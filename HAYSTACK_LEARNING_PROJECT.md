## 🎯 Project Overview

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development** methodology to systematically learn and implement Haystack-based AI systems. From basic components to production-ready RAG applications, this learning path provides structured progression with practical projects.

### What You'll Build
- 🔍 **Intelligent Search Systems** - Multi-modal search with semantic understanding
- 🤖 **RAG Applications** - Question-answering systems with multiple LLM providers
- 🛠️ **Custom Components** - Specialized components for unique business logic
- 🚀 **Production Systems** - Scalable, monitored, and deployed applications
- 📊 **Evaluation Frameworks** - Quality assessment and performance optimization

### Why This Approach Works
- **Specification-First**: Clear requirements before implementation
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build skills incrementally with hands-on practice
- **Real-World Focus**: Projects you can actually deploy and use
- **Community Driven**: Contribute back to the Haystack ecosystem
